ClientPacket
A ClientPacket is a packet comming crom the client -> server
It is very simmilar to the ServerPacket the main diffrenace is the sessionId.
It contains:
	crc: a crc of the message The crc has not been implemented yeet. It is always set to 45
	sessionId: used to identify which client sent the message
	offset: A offset number to the data starting at 0 when the connection is initiated.
	recivedoffset: The last offset the server sent to the client. Used to determine if there has been packetloss.
	commado: a number describing the purpose of the packet
		1,3 & 4 are for sending and reciving data.
		2 is for requesting a session id.
		4 is the server saying there is more data to retrive on the server.
		5 is used to indicate client error
	data: where the data part of the packet is.

As the client starts it will ask the server for a sessionId. For the rest of the session it will use the sessionId that it recived from the server to identify itself.

When it has recived it's sessionId it will start to poll the server for data.
